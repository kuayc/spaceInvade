Clone of classic arcade game SPACE INVADERS.
Space Invaders is a Japanese shooting video game released in 1978 by Taito. It was developed by Tomohiro Nishikado, who was inspired by other media: Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser to earn as many points as possible. It is one of the forerunners of modern video gaming and helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry.
